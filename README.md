# Toy Shopping-cart app

The plan here is simple: Build a toy shopping-cart app, made of multiple services so we can experiment and learn about distributed systems.

Pretty much anything is fair game.

There are only a few rules:
 * New things go into subfolders
 * Each thing should have a Dockerfile, so we can boot it in `docker-compose`

Feel free to try multiple langauges, write tests or not, expose a REST API, or maybe you feel like GraphQL?

List of current services:
 - none.
